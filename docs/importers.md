# Importers

Every importer produces normalized **executions** (fills). Trade-level exports are
reconstructed as one entry + one exit execution at the reported average prices. P&L is
preserved exactly; fill-level granularity is not (the warning says so on import).

Nothing is guessed silently: a file that doesn't match a known signature goes to the
column mapper, where the user maps their own headers.

## Formats and validation status

Parsers are **alias-driven**: every column is matched through a list of header aliases,
so fixing a drifted header is a one-line change.

Two validation tiers:

- **Cross-checked**: header set verified against _field sources_, meaning code that
  parses real user exports in the wild (TradeNote's community broker parsers¹, a
  real-user TradeZella converter², platform export docs), with fixtures in
  `packages/importers/tests` shaped from those sources.
- **Real file**: verified against an actual export file from a live account
  (the most valuable contribution this repo can receive).

¹ [TradeNote community broker parsers](https://github.com/Eleven-Trading/TradeNote/blob/main/src/utils/brokers.js):
real-user headers for Tradovate (`Fill Time`, `B/S`, `Filled Qty`, `Avg Fill Price`,
`Status=Filled`), TopstepX (`FilledAt`, `Side=Bid/Ask`, `PositionDisposition`,

`Commission`), ThinkorSwim section boundaries.
² [TradeZella_STB converter](https://github.com/drasticstatic/TradeZella_STB):
confirms `Open Date`, `Status` (win/loss), `Net P&L`, `trades_*.csv` filename, and
custom journal columns; TradeZella's own docs confirm timezone abbreviations may ride
in time fields (stripped by our date parser).
³ Tradervue's published generic format: `Date, Time, Symbol, Quantity, Price, Side` +
`Commission`/`TransFee`/`ECNFee`; TradingView's export docs: `Symbol, Side, Qty,
Fill Price, Closing Time` (+ optional `Type`, `Status`, `Commission`).

Known variants NOT yet handled (send a sample!): MetaTrader 5 xlsx "Trade History
Report" (the MT4-style `.htm` statement works), TradeZella exports with custom column
selections beyond the defaults.

## Sharp edges the parsers handle

- Quoted fields, embedded commas/newlines, BOM, `;`/tab delimiters (RFC 4180 parser,
  zero dependencies)
- `$1,234.56`, `(45.20)` negatives, European `1.234,56` decimals
- Naive timestamps interpreted in the **statement's timezone** (DST-safe two-pass
  conversion), explicit offsets honored as-is
- TradeZella P&L reconciliation: when stated net P&L differs from price-implied gross
  minus commissions, the difference is folded into fees so imported history agrees with
  the trader's old numbers to the cent (skipped when a contract multiplier makes the
  price-implied gross meaningless)
- Content-hash dedup on insert: re-importing the same file with the same timezone is a no-op
- Equity and index options default to a 100 multiplier unless **Settings → Journal** lists the exact symbol. OCC (`SPXW  260410C06865000`) and IBKR descriptive (`SPXW 19SEP25 6655 C`) symbols are canonicalized so the same contract does not split into two positions.

## Interactive Brokers Flex Query

IBKR Flex is the path for stocks, equity/index options, and commissions. The same XML parser serves **Accounts → Sync** and **Import → File upload**. CSV Flex exports still go through `@luxalgo/journal-importers`; XML is detected before CSV auto-detect (`ibkr-flex-xml`).

### File upload

**Import → File upload** accepts `.xml` as well as CSV/HTML. A Flex XML file is recognized by `<FlexQueryResponse>` plus at least one `<FlexStatement>`. Overlapping date ranges are safe: fills dedupe on IBKR `transactionID` (then `tradeID` / `ibExecID`), not on price/quantity/time, so economically identical partial fills stay distinct. Two IBKR accounts in one file (or across files imported into the same journal account) stay isolated with `ibkr-account:{accountId}` so their positions are never netted together. Unlike live sync, file import keeps unmatched closing fills so a later overlapping file can complete the round trip.

Do not commit Flex statements, SQLite databases, or `.secret` files; those paths are gitignored.

### Live sync

Read-only Flex Web Service sync still uses `@luxalgo/broker-sdk` for the request. The statement XML is then parsed here so option settlement, contract identity, and broker IDs survive. Sync and file import both dedupe on IBKR `transactionID` (then `tradeID` / `ibExecID`), so importing a Flex file into an account that already synced that trade does not store it again. Distinct partial fills that share a price and timestamp stay separate. A later sync can still attach broker fields to a fill saved before those ids existed. If a short sync window stored a smaller closing quantity for the same trade id, a later file with the broker's full quantity raises the stored fill; a later short sync does not shrink it. Closing fills that have no matching open inside the query window are omitted or clamped so pre-window history cannot open a reverse position.

Parser warnings appear on the Accounts sync alert and on the import commit alert.

### Flex Query sections and fields

In IBKR Account Management, include **Trades**. **Option Exercises, Assignments and Expirations** (`OptionEAE`) is optional: BookTrade rows in Trades already close many expired credit spreads. **Open Positions** helps the parser report expired contracts that still have no closing fill.

Minimum trade fields for stocks, options, and fees:

| Purpose                         | Flex attributes                                                                  |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Fill identity                   | `symbol`, `buySell`, `quantity`, `tradePrice`, `dateTime`, `ibCommission`        |
| Option contract                 | `strike`, `expiry`, `putCall`, `underlyingSymbol`, `assetCategory`, `multiplier` |
| Broker IDs (dedup / spreads)    | `transactionID`, `tradeID`, `ibExecID`, `ibOrderID`, `brokerageOrderID`          |
| Expiration and assignment value | `openCloseIndicator`, `notes`, `cost`, `fifoPnlRealized`                         |

Without Strike, Expiry, and Put/Call, an option fill is stored on the underlying ticker and will net with stock. Activity-statement CSV uses the same contract composition when those columns are present.

### How expiration is valued

IBKR often books expire / assign / exercise as a Trade with `tradePrice="0"`. The journal does not treat that as a $0 settlement when **Cost Basis** and **Realized P/L** are present:

`settlement = |cost − fifoPnlRealized| ÷ (quantity × multiplier)`

Notes such as `Ep` (expire), `A` (assignment), and `Ex` (exercise) are stored for audit. Worthless expiry typically settles at 0; cash-settled assignment/exercise is taken from the broker P&L, not assumed to be 0. If a zero-price close lacks both cost and realized P/L, the fill is skipped and a warning explains that the expiration value could not be determined.

When `OptionEAE` rows are present they close leftover quantity using Trade Price or Proceeds. They cannot invent a value the statement did not report.

### Spreads

Verticals are journaled as **one trade**. Combo legs share `brokerageOrderID` (IBKR's per-leg `ibOrderID` values are different and are not used as the spread id). When that parent order id is missing, same-expiry opposite legs that fill together — including same-second partials of both strikes — are still paired.

Direction follows the structure, not the net debit:

- Selling a call vertical is **short**
- Selling a put vertical is **long**

Strike width, credit/debit, max profit, max loss, and percent of max captured are computed from the two strikes and net premium. Regulatory fees in `taxes` are included with `ibCommission` in the fill fee.

### Recovering an earlier IBKR import

Option symbols, multipliers, or zero-price expirations imported before this parser can leave duplicate OCC vs descriptive rows or OPEN expired contracts. After upgrading:

1. Back up the data directory with the app stopped.
2. For a Flex **sync** account, run Sync again; stored option symbols are canonicalized and richer Flex fields update existing fills.
3. For **file** imports, create a new journal account and import the original XML (or overlapping XML files in date order), then compare closed-trade counts and P&L with IBKR before switching to that account.

## NinjaTrader execution exports

Each source account gets a saved identity inside the selected journal account.
Copy-traded positions and full contracts stay separate, even when their fills are
identical or their displayed symbols share a root such as `ES`. Account/connection
labels become aliases for that identity. If a later export renames or omits them,
map it to its existing source in the preview; choose **Create a separate source
account** only for a different account. Saved aliases cannot be reassigned.

When available, include the **ID** column from NinjaTrader's
[Executions grid](https://ninjatrader.com/support/helpGuides/nt8/executions_tab.htm).
It identifies an execution; **Order ID** can be shared by several partial fills.
`Execution ID` is also recognized. Native IDs are scoped to the saved source.
Re-exporting an execution adds no fill. Changed commissions are shown as corrections
and require explicit approval. Changed price, quantity, direction, instrument,
timestamp, or ordering facts stop the import for separate reconciliation.

Without execution IDs, the importer preserves the count of identical fills.
Re-importing the same file, or changing its row order, adds no fills. A changed
overlapping export requires confirmation that it contains **all executions for
each source contract between its first and last timestamp**. It must retain every
previously imported fill in that interval; the importer never silently deletes
missing fills. Do not confirm completeness for a partial selection. An exact
repeated export and a new set of indistinguishable fills cannot be told apart
without more source information. Keep execution-ID columns consistent across
exports or recover the complete history in a new journal account.

CSV display order is not treated as execution chronology. Timestamp ties require
an unambiguous order from Entry/Exit facts or a reliable numeric `Sequence` /
`Execution Sequence` column. Execution IDs are not assumed to be sequential.
Ambiguous fills and exits with missing opening history stop the import. Invalid
rows and malformed commission values also stop it, rather than rebuilding
positions from an incomplete file. A blank commission uses configured default
fees (or zero); an explicit zero stays zero.

Configure a positive contract multiplier for each exact imported futures symbol
in **Settings → Journal**, then review again. For the anonymized
[issue #10](https://github.com/LuxAlgo/trade-journal/issues/10) fixture, `MNQZ6=2`
produces five closed trades, 26 executions, and $5,265 before fees. Setting only
`MNQ=2` does not apply to `MNQZ6`; the new import is blocked until its multiplier
is configured. The sample supplies no commissions, so default fees can change
net P&L. This fixture validates the full row counts and arithmetic; it does not
prove the completeness or execution sequence of every possible broker export.

The review shows new fills, duplicates, proposed fee corrections, source mappings,
contract multipliers, and the destination account's resulting closed-trade P&L
and open/closed trade counts. Saving recomputes this plan in one transaction. If
the file, review choices, account, journal, or relevant settings changed since
preview, review it again. A failure rolls back fills, corrections, mappings and
import history together. Source mappings and import history are included in the
full JSON data export. Keep the statement timezone consistent with prior imports;
a changed timezone requires recovery into a new journal account.

### Previously imported NinjaTrader files

The old importer could discard real executions and source-account identity.
Re-importing with new identities on top of those surviving fills would double-count
them. Matching legacy fills therefore block the new import before any writes.
Import the complete original export into a **new journal account**, compare totals,
and select that account when reviewing the recovered trades. The old account and
its annotations remain unchanged. Do not include both old and recovered accounts
in aggregate reports. There is no automatic transfer of annotations from an old
merged position to its separate source-account positions.

The regression fixture is the reporter's anonymized CSV in
`packages/importers/tests/fixtures/ninjatrader-copy-trades.csv`; the expected result
treats its identical rows as separate executions, as stated by the reporter.

## Timestamp parsing upgrades

IBKR activity timestamps such as `2026-01-05, 09:30:00` retain the time after the
comma. Offset-free ISO, US and named-month timestamps retain up to three fractional
second digits; unsupported precision, trailing garbage and invalid calendar/time
values are rejected instead of silently losing part of the value. Explicit UTC
offsets remain authoritative.

Earlier imports may have stored IBKR timestamps at local midnight or dropped
fractional seconds. Reimports that match those earlier representations are blocked
before any writes: recover the complete corrected history in a new account and
compare totals and reviews. The same guard conservatively stops indistinguishable
whole-second fills; it does not guess whether they are legacy rows or genuine new
executions. Manual entry and broker sync are not subject to this file-import guard.
Existing timestamps are not automatically rewritten.

## Statement and display timezones

In **Settings → Journal**, set **Display timezone** to the zone you want for trade
times, analytics, calendars and journal days. Set **Default import timezone** to
the zone used by your broker's statement. On **Import → File upload**, you can
override the **Statement timezone** for an individual file without changing either
saved setting. The preview shows the first five executions in your display zone;
check these before importing. Changing the statement timezone requires a new preview.

All three timezone fields use a searchable picker. Search by city or timezone,
then select a result. The list includes the runtime's primary timezone names and
UTC. Existing aliases remain available; if a valid full timezone name is absent
from the main list, searching its exact name offers it as a selectable result.
Search text is not saved until you select a valid option.

For example, use `Europe/Helsinki` for a Helsinki-based MT5 statement and
`America/Asuncion` for your journal. The synthetic
[`mt5-timezone.html`](samples/mt5-timezone.html) has an entry at July 5, 2026, 04:00
and an exit at 04:30 in Helsinki. These are stored as 01:00 and 01:30 UTC and appear
as **July 4, 22:00 and 22:30** in Asunción, including in the trade list and journal.
Timestamps with an explicit offset or `Z` retain that instant regardless of the
statement timezone. Manual entry continues to use the device timezone.

Existing installations initially use their previous timezone as the import
default. Saving a display-only timezone change preserves that previous import
default. Neither setting rewrites stored executions.

### Correcting an earlier import

Changing the import timezone does not repair existing timestamps. Re-importing
with a different timezone creates different execution hashes and can add duplicate
trades. Before correcting data:

1. Make a full copy of the data directory with the app stopped, as described in
   [Export and backup](../README.md#export-and-backup), and retain the original statement.
2. Import into a separate test account with the correct statement timezone first.
   Verify the preview, execution times and journal day against the original report.
3. In the affected account, select and delete only the trades from the incorrect
   import, then import the original statement with the verified timezone. Trade
   deletion removes its executions and annotations; preserve notes, tags and linked
   material separately before deleting. For mixed or overlapping imports, reconcile
   which executions belong to the affected trades before deleting them.

There is no automatic bulk time shift: files can use different zones, explicit
offsets, and daylight-saving rules. A fixed hour adjustment is not reliable.

## Sample file

[`docs/samples/demo-trades-tradingview.csv`](samples/demo-trades-tradingview.csv) is a
synthetic TradingView paper-trading export: 13 symbols, about 2,000 fills, March 2025
through September 2026. Drop it on **Import → File upload** to try the importer end to
end. It is generated data, not a real account.

## Adding a format

1. Add a spec to `packages/importers/src/formats/`; most CSVs are a declarative
   `makeFillsFormat({...})` with header aliases.
2. Register it in `src/detect.ts` (content-signature formats before header-signature
   ones).
3. Add a fixture test in `tests/importers.test.ts` with a real (anonymized) export.
